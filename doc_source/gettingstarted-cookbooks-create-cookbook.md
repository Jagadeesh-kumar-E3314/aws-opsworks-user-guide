# Step 1: Create the Cookbook<a name="gettingstarted-cookbooks-create-cookbook"></a>

Start by creating a cookbook\. This cookbook won't do much to start\. However, it serves as a foundation for the rest of this walkthrough\.

**Note**  
This step demonstrates how to create a cookbook manually\. You can create a cookbook in less time with the Chef development kit \([Chef DK](https://docs.chef.io/#chef-dk-title)\) by running the command [https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-generate-cookbook](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-generate-cookbook) on your local workstation\. However, this command creates several folders and files that you won't need for this walkthrough\.

**To create the cookbook**

1. On your local workstation, create a directory named `opsworks_cookbook_demo`\. You can use a different name, but be sure to substitute it for `opsworks_cookbook_demo` throughout this walkthrough\.

1. In the `opsworks_cookbook_demo` directory, use a text editor to create a file named `metadata.rb` with the following code to specify the cookbook's name \(for more information, go to [metadata\.rb](https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_metadata.html)\): 

   ```
   name "opsworks_cookbook_demo"
   ```

1. In the `opsworks_cookbook_demo` directory, create a subdirectory named `recipes`\. This subdirectory will contain all of the recipes that you will create for this walkthrough's cookbook\.

1. In the `recipes` directory, create a file named `default.rb`\. This file contains a recipe with the same name as the file, but without the file extension: `default`\. Add the following single line of code to the `default.rb` file\. This code is a one\-line recipe that displays a simple message in the log when the recipe runs:

   ```
   Chef::Log.info("********** Hello, World! **********")
   ```

1. At the terminal or command prompt, use the tar command to create a file named `opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz`, which contains the `opsworks_cookbook_demo` directory and its contents\. For example:

   ```
   tar -czvf opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz opsworks_cookbook_demo/
   ```

   You can use a different file name, but be sure to substitute it for `opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz` throughout this walkthrough\.
**Note**  
When you create the `tar` file on Windows, the top directory must be the parent directory of the cookbook\. This walkthrough has been tested on Linux with the tar command provided by the `tar` package and on Windows with the tar command provided by [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)\. Using other commands or programs to create a compressed TAR \(\.tar\.gz\) file may not work as expected\.

1. Create an S3 bucket, or use an existing bucket\. For more information, see [Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)\.

1. Upload the `opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz` file to the S3 bucket\. For more information, see [Add an Object to a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/PuttingAnObjectInABucket.html)\.

You now have a cookbook that you will use throughout this walkthrough\.

In the [next step](gettingstarted-cookbooks-create-stack.md), you will create an AWS OpsWorks Stacks stack and its components—including an instance—that you will use later to upload your cookbook and to run the cookbook's recipes\.
